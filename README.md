##### Version 2.5

###### Published under GNU Affero General Public License, version 3

eyeOS is a web desktop following the cloud computing concept that seeks to enable collaboration and communication among users. It is mainly written in PHP, XML, and JavaScript. It is a private-cloud application platform with a web-based desktop interface. Commonly called a cloud desktop because of its unique user interface, eyeOS delivers a whole desktop from the cloud with file management, personal management information tools, collaborative tools and with the integration of the clientâ€™s applications.

eyeOS released version 2.5 on May 17,2011, which was the last release of the product under an open source license. 

I am attempting to fix the bugs left behind by the eyeOS team in this release as I find them, and then later add to it.
